* General
  - allow attaching scripts (not hooks-path) to specific hook phases
  - add `githooks fix-links` command to reset hook symlinks to those defined in config

* Config
  - only store githooks configuration in local repository config
    (means no need to store the repo path - it's implicit in the repo)

  - store sub-config for each hook phase, for example:
    [githooks pre-commit]
      hooks-path = ...
      script = ...
      etc...
    [githooks pre-push]
      hooks-path = ...
      ...

* DSL
  - encapsulate it into it's own class to isolate what's exposed
